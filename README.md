# JavaScript Next

This repo is my playground to test the JavaScript new features

## Examples

- [Data Structure](data-structure)
- [Destructuring Assignment](destructuring-assignment)
- [Iterators and Generators](iterators-generators/index.js)
- [Object entries](entries/index.js)

In case you have doubt why I'm not using semicolon is because I got inspiration from these talks:

- [Semicolons cannot save you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlr-FGbhKaI)
- [Are Semicolons Necessary in JavaScript?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfbh17Ax9I)
